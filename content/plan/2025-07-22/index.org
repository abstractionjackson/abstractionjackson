3. Rest

* Brain Dump
- sleep last night was poor
  - in bed before 1am
  - too quiet
  - then, noise from the mouse
  - a chirp, the fucker
  - clawing at the cushion under bed
  - goddamnit
- the trap went off, but didn't kill
- I was up at 7am, and should have gotten out of bed
  - The plan is to get up as early as naturally occurs, until I am sleeping through the night until later, if ever
  - supplement any sleep under 8 hours with a post-workout, pre-work rest.
  - ie. 7 hours of sleep (1am - 8am) + 1hour res (2pm - 3pm)
  - try this out today, going to the gym before lunch around 12pm, coming back to lunch and rest, then going to work
- meal-wise, I have a potato salad to bring again
  - I will need to prep again, tomorrow
  - I have eggs and potato for breakfast, beef and peppers for lunch, chicken and potato for dinner + sandwiches
- I'm not ready to give up on the mechanical trap, yet
  - small, sticky bait
- While I'm still figuring out the shape of my day on this new schedule, I was able to work in the morning yesterday on my personal website, but in the afternoon, my focus waned
- continue to be productive through the morning
- introduce the workout preceeding lunch
- attempt to be productive again, at some point
