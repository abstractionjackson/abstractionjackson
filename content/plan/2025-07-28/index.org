#+TITLE: Plan - July 28, 2025
#+SUMMARY: This morning, I will research startup companies in an effort to answer the question, "Given the market, and my skills, should I found a startup?". Then, I may go to the gym for legs (the squat, specifically). In the early afternoon, I have the option to write code or simply rest for the workday ahead, so long as I set a few mousetraps before I leave.

* Brain Dump

- slept in till 10:30AM
  - 11PM - 12:10AM, 12:15AM - 8:30AM
  - two hours of laziness in bed
- the mouse lives
  - set the traps before leaving for work
- the gym seems like a bad idea
  - what else do I have to do?
  - feel it out
- continue to look for work
- continue to develop software
- what about starting a start-up?
  - spend 15 minutes looking at what YC is funding
  - According to Cal Newport, a write should write a book if his idea is "of the moment" or important, and *he* is /the right person/ to ink it. (ie. the world needs to know about highly palatable foods BECAUSE a report came out that we're all fat, and I am the writer to tell the world BECAUSE I am a supertaster.)
  - The same may be true for startups.
  - Unfortunately, given my lack of skills, and demonstrated history of sitting on my ass, I'm probably *not* the /right founder for the startup/. But I don't know, and will explore.
- Logistics:
  - I've got enough food for today, and tonight
    - eggs and potato, peppers and onions, bacon for breakfast
    - tuna salad for lunch
    - chicken and hot sauce for dinner
  - I'll have to cook again tomorrow, including chicken and potato
  - That should hold me through to Thursday, when I'll need to grocery shop Safeway
    - salad, asparagus, cherry tomato, berries, bananas, canned tuna, salami, proscuitto, ...
- job search
  - send a few cold applies (?)
  - network (?)
  - I need some kind of approach...
