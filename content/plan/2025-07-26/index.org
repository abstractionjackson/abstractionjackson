#+TITLE: Plan - July 26, 2025
#+SUMMARY: I will this morning shop for groceries. Having eaten breakfast and cleaned up a bit around the house, I will study the double-entry acounting system of `ledger` in an effort to control my finances. In the late morning or early afternoon, I will ride to the gym, and workout the back, and perhaps sit in the sauna. During these hours, I will attempt to land a date with Ella, from Bumble, at a San Francisco spot. No matter the outcome, I will return to the Safeway after working out to buy salad greens, and additional lunch materials. Stay tuned for updates.
