People often ask, "What is your plan, today?"
For many years, I would improvise, saying that which came to mind. Therefore, I was planning on the spot, and because planning takes effort, my answers were often rough.
This application aims to correct my response by requiring that each morning I lay out a plan for the day such that when the inevitable question arises, I have a succinct response, satisfactory in content.
