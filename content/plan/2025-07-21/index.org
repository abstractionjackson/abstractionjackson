#+TITLE: Plan
#+SUMMARY: In the morning, I plan to work on the website of my design business, Golden Gate Software Solutions. I want to build a demo site for the portfolio section as if my client were a contractor. I could also do mintor improvements to my site itself. Finally, I will need to develop a business plan that includes lead generation, and marketing.
In the early afternoon, I will look for opening in tech for software engineers. Then I will eat a big lunch and pack a big dinner.
In the late afternoon, I will commute to Zoox, and begin training to perform the role of Autonomous Vehicle Operator. My goal is to expend as little energy as possible, in order to preserve my health, and focus my business and job search efforts.
