#+TITLE: Plan - July 24, 2025
#+SUMMARY: In the hours before work (11am - 3pm), I plan to organize the code of my [[https://abstractionjackson.com][*personal website*]], and -- time permitting -- build a /data visualization/ for the _workout_ section. Then, I will *look for software engineering opportunities* _online_, at /Indeed/ and /LinkedIn.com/. Finally, I will *build* out the home page of my /web design/ _business_, /Golden Gate Software Solutions/, to include a "Featured Client" section.
