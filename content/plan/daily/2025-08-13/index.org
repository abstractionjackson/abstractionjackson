#+TITLE: Plan - August 13, 2025
#+SUMMARY: I'm getting a late start on the day, having slept in. I'm pretty tired from four consecutive days in the gym, but I have two to go. *Legs* today. Before that, I will *look for work* online, and actively communicate to S. my goodwill. In what downtime I find, I may write some of the workout tracker and planner programs. Finally, I will ensure that I get proper nutrition, avoid wasting time on social media and television, and socialize -- even if its just for 15 minutes in the sauna.
