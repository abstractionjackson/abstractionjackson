#+TITLE: Plan - August 7, 2025
#+SUMMARY: A relaxed-pace day today: no lifting, no job search activities; instead, complete the sale of the Casio G-Shock by traveling by bike to the post office, packing, and shipping the item. Then, drop off library books at the Marina branch on the way back.  Finally, cook a protein supplement for tonight's meal: cubed chicken breast
