#+TITLE: Plan - August 9, 2025
#+SUMMARY: This morning, I listed a couple of clothing items *for sale* on /Poshmark/, had a conversation on the phone with my father, and sent a disput email for a financial issue. This afternoon, I will go to the gym, and *workout the back*. After that, I'll write some *code*, and shop for *groceries* at /Safeway/. In my free time, I can look for work, or watch the Giants game.
