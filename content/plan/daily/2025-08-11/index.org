#+TITLE: Plan - August 11, 2025
#+SUMMARY: This morning, I will code the planner schema before breakfast. After, I'll go to the gym, and train legs. Then, I'll look for work online, following-up with Boris at /TEKSystems/. Finally, I'll meal prep for the next few days: cubed chicken breast,  breaded and fried.
#+OVER_THE_WEEKEND: Friday night, I went home and stayed up watching TV. Saturday, I went to the gym, worked on a personal project, and watched an old movie on TV. Sunday, I went to the Thai massage parlor, and  wrote more code before dinner at my parents' house.
