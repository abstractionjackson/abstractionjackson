#+TITLE: Plan - August 4, 2025
#+SUMMARY: I plan to look for a job in software engineering, perform 15 minutes or more of business development, and strength train legs.
#+OVER_THE_WEEKEND: I went for a walk on the beach, ate at a new deli that just opened in my neighborhood, went for a bike ride through the park, and fired up the grill at my parents' house. Other than that, I went to the gym, and lay out in my back yard drinking beer and reading.
