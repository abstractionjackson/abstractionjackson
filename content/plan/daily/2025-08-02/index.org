* Brain Dump

- woke up at 9:30am
  - if I went to bed at 2:30am, then I got 7 hours of sleep
- I drank alone, ast night
  - not doubt this impacted the quality of my sleep, in the negative
  - not like the bars are closed, then
- I beat off
  - non-plussed, in the worst way
- so, what is up /TODAY/?
  - catch the mouse
  - clean the joint
  - go out for pickleball, or similar
    - maybe buy cup-o-noodle, but not /just/.
  - get some
    - exercise
