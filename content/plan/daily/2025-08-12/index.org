#+TITLE: Plan - August 12, 2025
#+SUMMARY: This morning, I will read the news for 90 minutes. Then I will eat breakfast, and begin to look for work online. If mother calls, I will attempt to meet with her sooner, rather than later. In the afternoon, I may go to the gym for strength and hypertrophy training, as well as a sauna. FinalNoly, this evening, I will try to socialize, meditate, or code.

* Agenda

** DONE Read the News

** DONE Job Search

*** Notes
- linkedin surfaced a post of San Francisco startups hiring
- 20 or so companies on the list
- send a job application to every open engineering role
- the poster's message to companies is "DM for candidates", so if I can join his list, then I'm "pre-vetted"...

*** Notes from Coversation: J.M. says,
- you have to give 100% effort, every day, and be able to sustain that over time
- otherwise, you'll never get anywhere
- life continually presents you with the same challenge, util you outwit the fucker, and move on

** DONE Meet Mom re: Property
- really a non-meeting
- announced, she did, that in three weeks, her sisters will convene to discuss the future of a Croft, and Edris, two family-co-owned properties in Los Angeles.
- if the family keeps both, Croft will need repair
- if the family sells one, the sale requires an agent

* Brain Dump

- fired, yesterday
  - no work, today
- return badge
- write glassdoor review
