* Brain Dump

- GGSS
  - how?

- I'm fucking angry about something, and I can't put my finger on it

  - My mother doesn't listen to a word I say:

    - she finishes the call by saying "I love you, bye-bye", hanging up before I can say I love you, too, then sulking because I don't love her.

    - It makes me feel MISERABLE

    - I am going to have to just say I love you as soon as she starts to say the words, and try to say love before she does

    - Something must be wroong to make her talk like that

  - My friend is nosy

    - he has good intentions

    - he is hyper critical

    - he's not helping

    - he wants things to move too quickly

  - What can I do?

    - show up to work, and continue to perform

    - adhere to my diet

    - get regular exercise

    - go out on the weekends

    - look for a day job that's actually in the day

    -
