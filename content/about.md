San Francisco Software Engineer **Jackson Galan** reserves the right to code, so long as it's in Emacs.
After a co-worker managed to get him to understand [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), he dusted off a pair of fingerless gloves, and began to fix the internet.
His first gig was aptly at a startup, where he wore mostly the front-end hat (mostly), and built a social event-planning app that would scale to 10,000+ MAU. ðŸ“ˆ
In the years since, the projects have changed, but the core technolgies have stayed the same; the methodologies remain agile, and the backends, written in JavaScript.
Outside of the development environment, Jackson is an avid cyclist (same gloves!) and voracious reader. Check out the [blog](/blog) for news, join a [bike ride](https://www.strava.com/athletes/7088902) (gloves: 100% mandatory), or reach out [to say hello](/social).
