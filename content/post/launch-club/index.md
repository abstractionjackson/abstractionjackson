[launchclubgolf.com](https://launchclubgolf.com) is home online to the Minneapolis golf simulator that shares its name. Managed via WordPress CMS, the site features not only promotional and informational content, but interactive e-commerce integrations for scheduling and payments. I joined the project in 2024 to help business owner Jason Gillis implement these features, and the result was improved User Experience (UX) and increased customer traffic.
