I bought this so I could track my swims. Some of the features I discovered include:

- Camera trigger: setup an iPhone camera, and use the watch to take a photo

A few of the apps **hobbled** ðŸ˜•

- For instance, YouTube Music won't let you search for songs, but you can start playlists.

<br />

A few of the apps are **underpowered**.

- For instance, Yale (a smark lock manager) provides a touch interface to open locks by name, but wouldn't it be great to use a voice command? That would allow me to carry another bag of groceries. Sadly Siri cannot talk to Yale. If Yale would integrate with Shortcuts, I could say "I'm home" to unlock the front door, and -- if it was after sunset -- turn on the hallway lights. C'mon, AGI, get it together.
