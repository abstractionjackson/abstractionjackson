A friend once asked, "Are you a watch guy?"

When I was a boy, my mother took me to Macy's in San Francisco's Stonestown Galleria, and bought her pride and joy a Fossil... While I can't recall the model, I can picture the box, a matte-finished aluminum cube that had illustration of a basketball player in short shorts and a slick haircut. Retro. The case was stainless steel, as was the bracelet, and I wore the timepiece in my adolescent years. More than a decade would pass until I decide, "You know what? I am a watch guy", and bought myself a Seiko King Turtle for $400 on Amazon.

I thought it looked cheap, and returned it in a matter of days.

At some point I bought a Casio G-Shock. It tells the time.
