My landlord recently installed a shoe closet in the hall. "How many pairs of shoes do you own?", he asked, and immediately offered a guess. "Eight?". I began to recollect the shoes in my collection.
"Dress shoes, boots, trainers, running shoes...", and that was about it. Half as many as expected. Is my shoe collection too little?
With so many types of shoes, I plan to here describe my thoughts on footwear, and collect examples of the boots, sandals, sneakers, slippers, etc. that I own, or would like to own, in an effort towards building a robust and stylish host to fill the closet. Besides the 8-pair framework, I have a few trusted brands in Allen Edmons, Atoms, and Asics, and will search the web and stores for more.
