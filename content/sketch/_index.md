In July of 2025, Jackson heard lecturer Chis Lonsdale [claim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0&t=682s) that anyone can learn to draw in five days. This sounded reasonable, and soon the clerk at a local art supply was ringing up Jackson for a sketchbook, pencils of varying hardness and blackness, and a kneaded eraser. He checked out Brigman's _Drawing from Life_ at the public library, and set about for a few days to learn the draw.
