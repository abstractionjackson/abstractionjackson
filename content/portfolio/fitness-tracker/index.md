I recently took part in a group ice-breaker, "App & App", that asked each of us to name our favorite appetizer, and favorite application. I went extremely high-brow with steak tartar (sp?) and Hoopla, but most people went with some iteration of breadsticks and social media. In fact, of the sixty-some-odd apps mentioned, only MyFitnessPal and Strava appeared from the fitness category. While we love to count our likes and friends, fitness can be more difficult to quantify, and therefore less available to the end-user. Resistance training, in particular, presents unqiue challenges around data-capture that to-date wearables and smart equipment has only partially solved.
