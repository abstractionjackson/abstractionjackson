## Genesis

I heard Cal Newport say something about a "Good Life" spreadsheet that his friend used to nudge life toward happiness. The conceit is that if, during the course of a given day, you record the significant actions you take, then -- at the end -- score the day on a 1 - 5 scale, you can look back to see trends in activity as correlated to high-score days.

For instance, if you call your mom to say "Hi" every Sunday, and you look back over six months to see that every Sunday is a 5, the phone call may be responsible. You could then try calling on Wednesday, too, and a few months later, analyze the Wednesday ratings against the same day during the previous months. A positive delta would suggest calling your mom leads to a better day, and maybe you should call her every day of the week. Pretty soon, you'll have moved back into the basement, and will own nothing, and be happy.

In all seriousness, the approach seems to have Newport convinced, and I personally like the meticulous cataloging aspect. I tried building it as described on the _Deep Questions_ podcast, using only a spreadsheet, but found that a single cell of unstructured text was a disorganized structure for capturing significant actions. Therefore, I built a _Hugo_ "archetype" to capture the date and time an activity was performed, as well as the description and a collection of tags. The latter should open up analytical possibilities, and helps keep repeat actions consistent (i.e. "Run 45 min." and "Run 3 mi." are both "run", "exercise", and "cardio"). Finally, the schema is flexible, so after I use it for a while, I can decide to add or remove elements.
