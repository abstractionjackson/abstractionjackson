# [European Leaders to Join Zelensky for White House Meeting](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/17/us/trump-news#trump-european-leaders-zelensky-meeting)
- Following Thursday's meeting between Putin and Trump in Alaska, Zelensky and the President will meet in Washington, Monday.
- Friday, the NYT amplified voices that characterized Thursday's meeting as a win for Putin.
- The last time Zelensky visited the White House resulted in a media spectacle, and argument between Trump, Vance, and the Ukrainian president.
	- Zelensky was underdressed, in tactical blacks
	- Zelensky appeared myopic
- Europe will send Merz, Macron, Starmer, Stubb (Finland), and more.
	- This could dilute Zelensky's unstable presence
	- In other words, the Europeans will stand beside Zelensky, not behind him.
	- Zelensky being the sub-par leader that he is, this is probably a benefit to the country of Ukraine
	- Reason will prevail

# [Three Republican-led States will Send National Guard Troops to Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/17/us/trump-news#west-virginia-national-guard-dc)
- WV, SC, OH are sending hundreds of troops to the capital
- The NYT has amplified voices (I'm going to be using that one _frequently_), that claim Trump characterized the capital is gang-infested, and crime-ridden, implying violent crime.
- I'm under the assumption that DC is having the same issues and other major cities, where violent crime is not excessive, but the streets are full of homeless, drug-addicted bums.
	- Not all the streets, but too many of them.
- The takeover of DC's police force by the Attorney General (...and Jean Pirro), and the deployment of national guard troops will serve as a test case
	- Given overwhelming force, can the Republicans achieve their desired outcome?
	- If they can, will other cities see a similar takeover? Will the Tenderloin ever be safe at night?
- What are the Republicans' stated aims?
	- The President says, ...
	- Bondi says, ...
	- The phrase "law and order" is in the mix
	- The White House says troops are there to "protect federal assets and provide a visible presence", like a deterrent.
- Finally, how does the deployment of National Guard to DC relate to that of summer in Los Angeles, to quell the anti-ICE protests?
	- No protest, crisis, or real emergency in the capital. Where's the fire? Dems might ask.

# [Israelis Join Nationwide Rallies to Call for Release of Hostages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/17/world/middleeast/israel-rallies-labor-strike.html)
- Thousands of Israelis called for their government to "reach an immediate truce" with Hamas, so that the hostages held in Gaza may be freed.
- Military forces in Inrael are gearing up to push into Gaza.
- What is the prevailing sentiment among Israeli's? Is this protest group a vocal minority?
	- My sense is _the citizenry can't control their government, and a few strongmen at the helm are **bent** on obliterating the Palestinian race_.
	- If they treated the hostage crisis as more than a mere pretext for such action, the government would broker an exchange.
	- Surely, the 60K dead Palestinians could be leverage in such a deal; in other words, Hamas must be willing to turn over the hostages, if Israel will stop winning the battles.
		- _Right?_
- After ~2 years of war, 20 of the hostages from Oct. 7, 2023 remain alive in captivity.
	- 30 bodies remain, as well
